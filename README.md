# Rings
Minetest mod that adds rings with temporary player effects

* _Activation Ring_ : activates/desactivates the rings (primary/secondary usage) and applies special effects (cf. Iron Fist)

* _Celestial Ring_ : allows to fly

* _Infernal Ring_ : gives fire resistance

* _Abyssal Ring_ : gives water resistance

* _Hardening Ring_ : gives Iron Fist (via Activation Ring)

* _Enlightning Ring_ : makes player shine

#### Where to find me ?  

I usually play on the Minerland server, and if not online, there is a mailbox at my home (in front of the travelnet cabine)

> Amelaye in Minerland \<amelaye.ddns.net:30000\>  
> More infos : http://minetest.amelieonline.net  

(also, my mods should run there)
