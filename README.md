# Rings
Minetest mod that adds rings with temporary player effects

* _Celestial Ring_ : allows to fly

* _Infernal Ring_ : gives fire resistance

* _Abyssal Ring_ : gives water resistance

* _Hardening Ring_ : gives Iron Fist (via Activation Ring)

* _Enlightning Ring_ : makes player shine

* _Activation Ring_ : provides control of the rings:
  - activates/desactivates the rings (primary/secondary usage) ;
  - applies special effects (cf. Iron Fist) ;
  - in sneak mode: toggles automatic activation/toggles hud (primary/secondary usage).

* _Random Ring_ : drops a random ring
